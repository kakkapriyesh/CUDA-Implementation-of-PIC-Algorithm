# CUDA-Implementation-of-PIC-Algorithm
This is a learning exercise to use GPU for scientific computing. The code is written in CUDA and C++ to create a simulation of two electron beams passing through each other in opposite directions. An interesting phenomenon occurs, called the Two-Stream Instability.
