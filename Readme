How to run this PIC project on GPU and CPU:

For GPU:

(1) access to the frontend machines in CRC ND
	
(2) request access to the node with GPU's installed
	qrsh -q gpu-debug -l gpu_card=1
	
(3) load the modules into GPU node
	module load cuda
	module show cuda
	
(3*) you may need to load the intel compiler for icpc as well
	module load intel/19.0 

(4) cd to the directory

(5)type in terminal: ./run.sh

The above shell script does the following things
a)compile the files (nvcc *.cu main.cpp -std=c++11) 
b)runs the output a.out(./a.out)
c)plots the data from the text file of outputs(PICresult.txt) using python code in (plot.py)

To run the simulation on CPU:

Just change the input.h to define (device_CPU) file and run the shell script run.sh (./run.sh)
